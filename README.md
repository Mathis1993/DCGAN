# DCGAN
A small workshop for creating face images with a GAN in Pytorch.

Mainly following this Pytorch [tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html) by Nathan Inkawhich.

There are four notebooks:
1. DCGAN: The notebook containing the full code and outputs
2. DCGAN_collapsed_view: Has full code but not output. Cells are collapsed. Serves for participants as a reference when getting stuck on completing an assignment.
3. DCGAN_tasks: Has incomplete code and assignments participants should solve.
4. Specify_Models_Pytorch: A quick overview of how to define an ANN in Pytorch.
