# DCGAN
A small workshop for creating face images with a GAN in Pytorch.

All code is provided in Google Colaboratory notebooks with the face data being managed in Google Drive (sample data of 5000 images to add to your drive can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19zewI-wxU-EACyo5yWyrIErzlj-sX-1j)).

The workshop mainly follows [this](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html) Pytorch tutorial by Nathan Inkawhich.

There are four notebooks:
1. DCGAN: The notebook containing the full code and outputs
2. DCGAN_collapsed_view: Has full code but no output. Cells are collapsed. Serves for participants as a reference when getting stuck on completing an assignment.
3. DCGAN_tasks: Has incomplete code and assignments participants should solve.
4. Specify_Models_Pytorch: A quick overview of how to define an ANN in Pytorch.
